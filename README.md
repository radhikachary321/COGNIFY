# HTML Structure and Basic Server Interaction
This project introduces the concept of server-side rendering and basic form submissions using Node.js and Express.
# Objective
• To build a simple HTML structure with forms.

• To set up a Node.js server with Express.

• To handle form submissions using server-side endpoints.

• To dynamically render HTML using EJS.

# 🚀 Features

• User input form (HTML).

• Express.js server setup.

• POST/GET endpoints to handle form data.

• Dynamic server-side rendering with EJS.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

• HTML – Frontend structure

• Node.js – Runtime environment

• Express.js – Backend framework

• EJS – Server-side rendering

# Inline Styles, Basic Interaction, and Server-Side Validation

This project focuses on expanding inline styles, adding basic client-side interaction, and implementing server-side validation for form submissions.

# 📌 Objective

Extend HTML with more complex forms and interactions.

Apply inline JavaScript for client-side form validation.

Validate submitted data on the server side.

Store validated data in temporary server-side storage.


# 🚀 Features

Enhanced HTML forms with multiple input fields.

Inline JavaScript for real-time client-side validation.

Server-side validation using Express.js.

Temporary storage of validated form data (in-memory).


# 🛠 Technologies Used

HTML – Extended form structures

JavaScript – Client-side validation

Node.js & Express.js – Backend + server-side validation

EJS – Dynamic rendering (if needed)
